My team and I secured 2nd position in National AI Hackathon out of 100+ teams across India.
The task at hand was to detect a gate underwater along with its center so that an autonomous bot could pass through it.
We used state of the art algorithms like CLAHE and ULAP to restore true scene radiance under water. Using methods like Otsu's thresholding, Canny Edge Detection, Contour Moments we were successfully able to detect the gate's center.
