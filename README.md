My team and I secured 2nd position in National AI Hackathon out of 100+ teams across India.

Problem Statement:
You are working on an autonomous underwater vehicle that is navigating underwater avoiding obstacles and achieving targets. In the navigation there comes a gate of which you know the dimensions and color. The bot must pass through it without touching it in order to complete the mission.
You have to write code for detecting the gate and to know its center in order for the bot to pass through it. You will get the raw images from the camera and youâ€™ll have to perform image processing on it and get the results.
Object detection is performed in the notebook, [Submarine_Surfers.ipynb](https://github.com/utkarsh1706/HackOverflow/blob/main/Submarine_Surfers.ipynb), using methods of contouring and thresholding using Canny Edge Detection.
